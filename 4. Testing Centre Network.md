# **Labsheet: Testing Centre Network Configuration**

### **Scenario: Testing Centre Network Design**

The Testing Centre network design consists of VLANs, devices, interconnectivity, and security measures. The goal is to configure VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, ensure port security, and test the network's functionality in Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## **Network Setup**

### **Floor-wise VLAN Allocation**

1. **Ground Floor:**
   - **Test Labs 1-4:**
     - Test Lab 1: 5 PCs (VLAN 90)
     - Test Lab 2: 5 PCs (VLAN 90)
     - Test Lab 3: 7 PCs (VLAN 90)
     - Test Lab 4: 8 PCs (VLAN 90)
   - **IT Department Technicians:** 6 PCs (VLAN 100)

2. **First Floor:**
   - **Engineering Technicians:** 5 PCs (VLAN 110)

---

## **Step-by-Step Configuration**

### **1. Device Placement**
- **Layer 3 Switch:** Manages VLAN routing and connects to the core router.
- **Access Switches:**
  - One access switch for each floor.
- **End Devices:** PCs for test labs, IT technicians, and engineering technicians connected to the appropriate VLANs.

---

### **2. VLAN Creation and Assignment**

#### **Layer 3 Switch Configuration**

1. Create VLANs:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
vlan 90
 name Test_Labs
vlan 100
 name IT_Technicians
vlan 110
 name Engineering_Technicians
exit
```

2. Assign IP addresses to VLAN interfaces:
```bash
interface vlan 90
 ip address 192.168.90.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 100
 ip address 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 110
 ip address 192.168.110.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

3. Configure trunking for Access Switches:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 90,100,110
 no shutdown
```

#### **Access Switch Configuration**

1. Assign VLANs to ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 90
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 100
interface FastEthernet0/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 110
```
(Repeat for other access switch ports as needed.)

2. Configure trunking to connect access switches to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 90,100,110
 no shutdown
```

---

### **3. Port Security and Hardening**

1. Disable unused ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range FastEthernet0/12-24
 shutdown
```

2. Enable port security on access ports:
```bash
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation restrict
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
```
(Repeat for all active access ports.)

3. Limit management access:
```bash
line vty 0 4
 password strongpassword
 login
 transport input ssh
```

4. Disable unnecessary services:
```bash
no ip http server
no ip http secure-server
```

---

### **4. Routing Configuration on Core Router**

1. Configure the interface connecting to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

2. Add static routes for VLANs:
```bash
ip route 192.168.90.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.2
ip route 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.2
ip route 192.168.110.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.2
```

---

### **5. Firewall Configuration**

1. Configure basic firewall rules on the router:
```bash
access-list 300 permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 300 deny ip any any log
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 300 in
```

2. Enable NAT for internet access:
```bash
ip nat inside source list 300 interface GigabitEthernet0/0 overload
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip nat outside
interface GigabitEthernet1/0
 ip nat inside
```

3. Test firewall rules:
   - Ensure internal devices can access external networks.
   - Block unauthorized external access to internal VLANs.

---

### **6. Testing the Configuration**

#### **Connectivity Tests**
1. **Intra-VLAN Communication:**
   - Ping between devices in the same VLAN to ensure local connectivity.

2. **Inter-VLAN Communication:**
   - Ping between devices in different VLANs to verify inter-VLAN routing.

#### **Performance Monitoring**
- Use Packet Tracer simulation mode to trace packets and ensure proper traffic flow.

#### **Firewall Testing**
- Attempt to access blocked resources to verify firewall rules.
- Ensure allowed traffic passes through successfully.

---

### **7. Additional Testing Steps**
- Verify trunk ports using the `show interfaces trunk` command.
- Check VLAN status using the `show vlan brief` command.
- Test port security by connecting unauthorized devices to access ports.

### **Deliverables**
1. **Packet Tracer File:** Complete configuration with all VLANs, devices, and security measures.
2. **Testing Results:** Screenshots of successful ping tests within and across VLANs.
3. **Documentation:** Include CLI outputs for VLAN, trunk, port security, and routing configurations.
4. **Firewall Validation:** Logs showing blocked and allowed traffic.
