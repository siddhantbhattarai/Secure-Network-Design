For the **next part**, let's design the **Security Booths and Amenities Building Network** in Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

### **Scenario: Security Booths and Amenities Building Network Design**
The setup includes:
1. **Security Booths and Gates:**
   - Goods Gate Security Booth: 2 PCs (VLAN 140).
   - Security Chief's Office: 1 PC (VLAN 140).

2. **Amenities Building:**
   - Ground Floor:
     - Staff Canteen POS: 2 PCs (VLAN 150).
   - First Floor:
     - Internet Browsing Stations: 6 PCs (Guest VLAN 160).
   - Kitchen and Storage: 2 PCs for stock and orders (VLAN 150).

---

### **Step-by-Step Configuration**

#### **1. Device Placement**
- **Layer 3 Switch:** Manages VLAN routing and connects to the core router.
- **Access Switches:**
  - One for the Security Booths.
  - One for the Amenities Building.
- **End Devices:** PCs for security, staff, POS, and internet browsing.

#### **2. VLAN Creation and Assignment**

**Layer 3 Switch Configuration**
1. Create VLANs:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
vlan 140
 name Security_Booths
vlan 150
 name Amenities_POS
vlan 160
 name Guest_Internet
exit
```

2. Assign IP addresses to VLANs:
```bash
interface vlan 140
 ip address 192.168.140.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 150
 ip address 192.168.150.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 160
 ip address 192.168.160.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

3. Configure trunking for Access Switches:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 140,150,160
 no shutdown
```

---

**Access Switch Configuration**
1. Assign VLANs to ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 140
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 150
interface FastEthernet0/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 160
```
Repeat for all relevant ports.

---

#### **3. Routing Configuration on Core Router**
1. Configure the interface connecting to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/4
 ip address 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

2. Add static routes for VLANs:
```bash
ip route 192.168.140.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.5.2
ip route 192.168.150.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.5.2
ip route 192.168.160.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.5.2
```

---

#### **4. Testing the Configuration**
1. **Connectivity Tests:**
   - Ping between devices within the same VLAN.
   - Ensure that Guest VLAN devices (VLAN 160) cannot access internal VLANs.
2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Use Packet Tracer simulation mode to validate security and data flow.
