# **Labsheet: Admin Building Network Configuration**

### **Scenario: Admin Building Network Design**

The Admin Building network design consists of multiple VLANs, devices, interconnectivity, and security measures. The goal is to configure VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, ensure port security, firewall setup, and test the network's functionality in Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## **Network Setup**

### **Floor-wise VLAN Allocation**
1. **Ground Floor:**
   - VLAN 10 (Finance): 5 PCs, 1 Printer
   - VLAN 20 (Reception): 1 PC

2. **First Floor:**
   - VLAN 30 (Sales): 2 PCs (Director & PA)
   - VLAN 40 (Admin Assistants): 6 PCs, 1 Printer, 1 Scanner

3. **Second Floor:**
   - VLAN 50 (Executive): 3 PCs (Managing Director, PA, Boardroom)

---

## **Step-by-Step Configuration**

### **1. Device Placement**
- **Core Router:** Connects the external network to the Admin Building network.
- **Layer 3 Switch (3650):** Manages VLAN routing and interconnectivity.
- **Access Switches (2960):** Provides connections for end devices on each floor.
- **End Devices:** PCs, Printers, and Scanners connected to the appropriate VLANs.

---

### **2. VLAN Creation and Assignment**

#### **Layer 3 Switch Configuration**

1. Configure VLANs:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
vlan 10
 name Finance
vlan 20
 name Reception
vlan 30
 name Sales
vlan 40
 name Admin_Assistants
vlan 50
 name Executive
exit
```

2. Assign IP addresses to VLAN interfaces:
```bash
interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 30
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 40
 ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 50
 ip address 192.168.50.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

3. Configure trunking between Layer 3 and Access Switches:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50
 no shutdown
```

#### **Access Switch Configuration**

1. Assign VLANs to ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
```
(Repeat this configuration for other ports on each access switch.)

2. Configure trunking to connect access switches to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50
 no shutdown
```

---

### **3. Port Security and Hardening**

1. Disable unused ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range FastEthernet0/5-24
 shutdown
```

2. Enable port security on access ports:
```bash
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation restrict
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
```
(Repeat for all active access ports.)

3. Limit management access:
```bash
line vty 0 4
 password strongpassword
 login
 transport input ssh
```

4. Disable unnecessary services:
```bash
no ip http server
no ip http secure-server
```

---

### **4. Firewall Configuration**

1. Configure basic firewall rules on the router:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
access-list 100 permit ip any 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 100 deny ip any any log
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 100 in
```

2. Enable NAT for internet access:
```bash
ip nat inside source list 100 interface GigabitEthernet0/0 overload
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip nat outside
interface GigabitEthernet1/0
 ip nat inside
```

3. Test firewall rules:
   - Ensure internal devices can access external networks.
   - Block unauthorized external access to internal VLANs.

---

### **5. Router Configuration**

1. Configure the interface connecting to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

2. Add static routes for VLANs:
```bash
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.50.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
```

---

### **6. Testing the Configuration**

#### **Connectivity Tests**
1. **Intra-VLAN Communication:**
   - Ping between devices in the same VLAN to ensure local connectivity.

2. **Inter-VLAN Communication:**
   - Ping between devices in different VLANs to verify inter-VLAN routing.

#### **Performance Monitoring**
- Use Packet Tracer simulation mode to trace packets and ensure proper traffic flow.

#### **Firewall Testing**
- Attempt to access blocked resources to verify firewall rules.
- Ensure allowed traffic passes through successfully.

---

### **7. Additional Testing Steps**
- Test printer functionality by sending print jobs from PCs in the same VLAN.
- Verify trunk ports using the `show interfaces trunk` command.
- Check VLAN status using the `show vlan brief` command.
- Test port security by connecting unauthorized devices to access ports.

### **Deliverables**
1. **Packet Tracer File:** Complete configuration with all VLANs, devices, and security measures.
2. **Testing Results:** Screenshots of successful ping tests within and across VLANs.
3. **Documentation:** Include CLI outputs for VLAN, trunk, port security, and routing configurations.
4. **Firewall Validation:** Logs showing blocked and allowed traffic.
