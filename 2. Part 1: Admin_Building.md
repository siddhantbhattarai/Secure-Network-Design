Letâ€™s create an example configuration for **Part 1: Admin Building** with VLANs, devices, and interconnectivity in Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

### **Scenario: Admin Building Network Design**
The Admin Building has the following setup:
1. **Ground Floor:**
   - VLAN 10 (Finance): 5 PCs, 1 Printer.
   - VLAN 20 (Reception): 1 PC.
2. **First Floor:**
   - VLAN 30 (Sales): 2 PCs (Director & PA).
   - VLAN 40 (Admin Assistants): 6 PCs, 1 Printer, 1 Scanner.
3. **Second Floor:**
   - VLAN 50 (Executive): 3 PCs (Managing Director, PA, Boardroom).

---

### **Step-by-Step Configuration in Packet Tracer**

#### **1. Device Placement**
- **Core Router:** Connects to the Admin Building's Layer 3 switch.
- **Layer 3 Switch:** Manages VLAN routing and interconnects the access switches.
- **Access Switches (One per Floor):** Distribute connections to end devices.
- **End Devices:** PCs, Printers, and Scanners.

#### **2. VLAN Creation and Assignment**

**Layer 3 Switch Configuration**
1. Configure VLANs:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
vlan 10
 name Finance
vlan 20
 name Reception
vlan 30
 name Sales
vlan 40
 name Admin_Assistants
vlan 50
 name Executive
exit
```

2. Assign IP addresses to VLANs:
```bash
interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 30
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 40
 ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 50
 ip address 192.168.50.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

3. Configure trunking between Layer 3 and access switches:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50
 no shutdown
```

---

**Access Switch Configuration**
1. Assign VLANs to ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
```
Repeat for other floors, adjusting VLAN IDs.

---

#### **3. Routing Configuration on Core Router**
1. Configure interfaces connecting to Layer 3 switches:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

2. Add static routes for VLANs:
```bash
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.50.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
```

---

#### **4. Testing the Configuration**
1. **Connectivity Tests:**
   - Ping between devices within the same VLAN.
   - Ping across VLANs to test inter-VLAN routing.
2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Use Packet Tracer simulation mode to verify traffic flow.
