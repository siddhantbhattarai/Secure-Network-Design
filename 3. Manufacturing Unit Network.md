For the **second part**, let’s design the **Manufacturing Unit Network** in Cisco Packet Tracer. The Manufacturing Unit includes the following:

---

### **Scenario: Manufacturing Unit Network Design**
- **Machine Shop 1:**
  - 5 PCs controlling precision lathes (VLAN 60).
- **Machine Shop 2:**
  - 6 PCs controlling micro-lathes.
  - 2 PCs controlling robot paint units (VLAN 70).
- **Foreman’s Office and Store Master:**
  - 4 PCs used for stock and management (VLAN 80).

---

### **Step-by-Step Configuration**

#### **1. Device Placement**
- **Layer 3 Switch:** Manages VLAN routing and connects to the core router.
- **Access Switches:** 
  - One for Machine Shop 1.
  - One for Machine Shop 2 and the Foreman’s Office.
- **End Devices:** PCs for lathes, robots, and offices.

---

#### **2. VLAN Creation and Assignment**

**Layer 3 Switch Configuration**
1. Create VLANs:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
vlan 60
 name Precision_Lathes
vlan 70
 name Micro_Lathes_Robots
vlan 80
 name Stock_Management
exit
```

2. Assign IP addresses to VLANs:
```bash
interface vlan 60
 ip address 192.168.60.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 70
 ip address 192.168.70.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 80
 ip address 192.168.80.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

3. Configure trunking for Access Switches:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 60,70,80
 no shutdown
```

---

**Access Switch Configuration**
1. Assign VLANs to ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 60
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 70
interface FastEthernet0/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 80
```

Repeat for other access switch ports as needed.

---

#### **3. Routing Configuration on Core Router**
1. Configure the interface connecting to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

2. Add static routes for VLANs:
```bash
ip route 192.168.60.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2
ip route 192.168.70.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2
ip route 192.168.80.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2
```

---

#### **4. Testing the Configuration**
1. **Connectivity Tests:**
   - Ping between devices within the same VLAN.
   - Ping across VLANs to test inter-VLAN routing.
2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Verify traffic flow using Packet Tracer simulation mode.
