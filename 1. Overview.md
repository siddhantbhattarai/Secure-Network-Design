Designing the network for such a large and complex setup in Cisco Packet Tracer is best done **part by part**, ensuring modularity, easier troubleshooting, and scalability. Here's a step-by-step plan for designing the network in manageable sections:

---

### **1. Network Design Strategy**
#### **Step 1: Plan Subnetting**
- **Identify and divide the network into logical subnets** based on departments:
  - Admin Building
  - Manufacturing Unit
  - Testing Centre
  - Warehouses
  - Security Booths and Gates
  - Amenities Building
- Use VLANs to segregate traffic within the same subnet (e.g., VLAN for testing labs, admin, etc.).
- Assign IP ranges to each subnet using a private IP scheme (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).

#### **Step 2: Device Selection**
- **Core Network Devices:**
  - Core Router: For interconnecting all subnetworks.
  - Layer 3 Switch: For VLAN routing within buildings.
  - Access Switches: To connect PCs and printers.
- **End Devices:**
  - PCs, printers, scanners, and industrial equipment.
- **Additional Equipment:**
  - Wireless Access Points (for amenities and admin).
  - Security Cameras (optional for security booths).

#### **Step 3: Modular Design**
Work on each part individually, test functionality, and then integrate with the core network:
- **Part 1:** Admin Building.
- **Part 2:** Manufacturing Unit.
- **Part 3:** Testing Centre.
- **Part 4:** Warehouses.
- **Part 5:** Security Booths.
- **Part 6:** Amenities Building.

### **2. Implementation Steps in Cisco Packet Tracer**
#### **A. Core Network Setup**
1. Place a **core router** and assign interfaces for each building/department.
2. Set up a **Layer 3 switch** for VLAN routing and trunking.
3. Designate trunk ports between the Layer 3 switch and core router.

#### **B. Admin Building**
1. Create VLANs for different departments:
   - VLAN 10: Finance
   - VLAN 20: Sales
   - VLAN 30: Reception
2. Place access switches on each floor and connect PCs, printers, and other devices.
3. Configure VLANs on access switches and ensure trunking to the Layer 3 switch.
4. Test inter-VLAN routing via the Layer 3 switch.

#### **C. Manufacturing Unit**
1. Create a subnet for industrial devices.
2. Place access switches to connect PCs controlling lathes and robots.
3. Set up secure VLANs for industrial devices to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Test communication between PCs and control systems.

#### **D. Testing Centre**
1. Create a separate VLAN for testing labs and IT technicians.
2. Set up access switches on each floor to connect PCs.
3. Ensure isolated communication between labs and IT networks.

#### **E. Warehouses**
1. Use a simple switch configuration for warehouse PCs.
2. Connect warehouse PCs to the core router via access switches.
3. Set up security policies for inventory systems.

#### **F. Security Booths & Amenities Building**
1. Configure VLANs for security booths and integrate surveillance systems.
2. For amenities, set up Wi-Fi access points with isolated guest networks.

### **3. Key Configuration Points**
#### **VLAN Configuration Example:**
```bash
# On Layer 3 Switch
interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0

# Trunk Port
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

#### **Routing Example (Router):**
```bash
# Static Route Configuration
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2
```

#### **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
- Apply ACLs on router interfaces to restrict access between subnets:
```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 100 deny ip any any
```

---

### **4. Testing and Integration**
- **Ping Test:** Validate connectivity between devices in the same VLAN and across VLANs.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Use Packet Tracer simulation mode to analyze traffic flow.
- **Security Testing:** Simulate unauthorized access attempts and verify ACL effectiveness.

---

### **5. Final Integration**
- Connect all subnets to the core router.
- Test end-to-end connectivity across all parts of the network.
- Ensure redundancy using multiple trunk connections for critical buildings.
