For the **next part**, let's design the **Warehouses Network** in Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

### **Scenario: Warehouses Network Design**
The Warehouses include the following:
1. **Warehouse 1 (Large Scale Products):**
   - Storeman's Office: 2 PCs (VLAN 120).
   - Goods Dispatch Area: 1 PC (VLAN 120).

2. **Warehouse 2 (Small Products, 2 Floors):**
   - Ground Floor:
     - Storeman’s Office: 1 PC (VLAN 130).
   - First Floor:
     - Storage: No PCs.

3. **Main Warehouse Storage Area:** 
   - No PCs or network-connected devices.

---

### **Step-by-Step Configuration**

#### **1. Device Placement**
- **Layer 3 Switch:** Manages VLAN routing and connects to the core router.
- **Access Switches:**
  - One for Warehouse 1.
  - One for Warehouse 2.
- **End Devices:** PCs in Storeman’s Offices and Goods Dispatch Area.

---

#### **2. VLAN Creation and Assignment**

**Layer 3 Switch Configuration**
1. Create VLANs:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
vlan 120
 name Warehouse_1
vlan 130
 name Warehouse_2
exit
```

2. Assign IP addresses to VLANs:
```bash
interface vlan 120
 ip address 192.168.120.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface vlan 130
 ip address 192.168.130.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

3. Configure trunking for Access Switches:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 120,130
 no shutdown
```

---

**Access Switch Configuration**
1. Assign VLANs to ports:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 120
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 130
```
Repeat for other access switch ports as needed.

---

#### **3. Routing Configuration on Core Router**
1. Configure the interface connecting to the Layer 3 switch:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip address 192.168.4.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

2. Add static routes for VLANs:
```bash
ip route 192.168.120.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.4.2
ip route 192.168.130.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.4.2
```

---

#### **4. Testing the Configuration**
1. **Connectivity Tests:**
   - Ping between devices within the same VLAN.
   - Ping across VLANs to test inter-VLAN routing.
2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Verify traffic flow using Packet Tracer simulation mode.
